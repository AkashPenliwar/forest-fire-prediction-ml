#  Forest Fire Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of forest fires based on various environmental and weather-related features. It is aimed at assisting forest departments and disaster management teams in identifying potential fire risks and responding proactively.

##  Features

- Predicts forest fire risk using historical and real-time data
- Uses supervised ML models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.
- Visualizes correlations between features (temperature, humidity, etc.)
- User-friendly interface for input and prediction (if UI included)
- Helps in making informed decisions to minimize fire damage

---

##  Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Streamlit (if applicable)
- Jupyter Notebook (for model training and testing)

##  How It Works

1. Data is collected containing weather conditions and fire labels.
2. Data is preprocessed and visualized for insight.
3. Models are trained to classify whether a forest fire will occur.
4. Best-performing model is selected based on accuracy and performance metrics.
5. A web interface (optional) allows users to input live data and get predictions.
